Hello, this is Devon James's project 1.

Here are instructions to run this program:

1)Open PUTTY and access flip3. (Program only runs on flip3)

2)We want to run the server first, so type python ./chatserver.py [port#]. Replace [port#] with the port number that you want to use to run the server on.

3)Open another PUTTY window, and type make to compile the chat executable. This is for running the client side 

4)To run the client side executable type ./chat [server name] [port #] where [server name] is flip3 and [port #] is the same port number you used to run the server.

5)Now the client and server are connected and messages can be sent to and from each other.

6)If you want to exit the program, type \quit when it is the chat or server turn to chat.

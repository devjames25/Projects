	<h2 align="center">About Me</h2>
	<p id="Essay">I was born in Silver Spring, Maryland on December 25, 1992<strong>(Yes, I'm a Christmas baby!)</strong>
	from two Jamaican parents. I lived there until 1997 when my family moved to West Palm Beach, Florida.
	In 2008, I got accepted in the International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme for Suncoast High School in
	Riviera Beach, Florida. I was able to pass the program and graduate with the IB diploma and from there
	I got accepted to the University of South Florida in Tampa to the pre-engineering program in the Summer of 2011.
	After a year in the program, I dediced to switch my major to a dual major in Business and Social Science and I
	graduated with the Bachelors in December 2015. Next month, I moved back to West Palm Beach and got a job as a
	case worker in a hospital. While working there, I orginally planned to apply to graduate school for a masters in social work.
	However, working there for about a year made me question if I want to purse that career until I dedcided that I want to pursue
	another career. While working as a case worker, I became interested in programming by doing in for fun. I later decided to
    pursue a career as a software developer.Orginally, I was planning to go for a masters in Computer Science until 
    I found the post-baccalaureate program for Oregon State University, so here I am today!
